A simple social networking website, built using React and Firestore.

**Technologies used: React (with Hooks), React Router, Firestore**

Login using your GMail, or use one of the premade test accounts. Post a message, and open the chat in the sidebar. This is very much still a work in progress, but it has been a very useful learning experience.
