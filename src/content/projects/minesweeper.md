The classic game which I spent far too much time playing.

**Built without a framework, using static HTML, Typescript, and SCSS**

This was a fun experiment in retro styling, but also in working with OOP as opposed to my normal functional programming style. I'm very happy with the results.

Double click the icon to start the game, or see the code in <a href='https://github.com/rtp314/minesweeper' target='_blank'>the github repository</a>
